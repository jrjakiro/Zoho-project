Queue
Linear data structure
First In First Out Principle
Operations : Front, Rear, Enqueue & Dequeue
Implementation : 
Array 
Easy implementation 
Not a dynamic and canâ€™t grow or shrink during runtime.
Linked-list
Dynamic size 
But require more space.
Standard Template library
Easiest Implementation 
But the compile time will be larger than other two methods. 
Priority Queue:
Every element is associated with a priority.
Higher priority element is dequeued before the lower priority elements
Incase of same priority, elements will be dequeued on the order of queue
